// PLEASE READ THIS!!!!
// This file is really just a dummy. The release process will remove this file and generate some read embedded files
// and commit these into a temporary branch and then tag it. This is to avoid clogging up the main branch with too many
// binary files, which would be a very bad experience when pulling in go-embed-python as a dependency.
